Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of hihg quality software systems.
Involves the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages such as Fortran and C
Establishment of Software Engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
Advent of structured programming in the 1970s
Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements- Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design- Creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation- Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing- Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment- Releasing the software to users.
Maintenance- Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall whereas the agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.
Waterfall methodology would be approriate in scenarios where the project and system require strict compliance and documentation like Government Projects. On the other hand Agile Methodology would best be appropriate in scenarios where the systems needs frequent updates and iterative improvements are based on user feedback to guide and enhance the final product e.g. in Mobile App and Game Development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer- Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager- Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are important in the development process because they provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g. Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntlliJ IDEA.
VCS are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g. Git, Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements- Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines- Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt- Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions which can impede future development efforts and increased maintenance costs.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges- Effective communication among team members, using agile methodologies, prioritizing important tasks first, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing- Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing- Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing- Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing- Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the process of designing and refinig text based inputs to optimize the output of AI models. It involves structuring queries, providing context, and using specific words to guide an AI model in generating accurate, relevant, and high quality responses.
Importance of prompt engineering is that it enhances accuracy and relevance by mitigating bias and errors.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt- "Tell me about MacGyver"
Improved prompt- "Kindly give me a detailed explanation of the character development of Angus MacGyver in the 2016 MacGyver Series, focusing on his growth from Season 1 to Season 5"
Why the improved prompt is more effective- Provides a clear focus on the scope of the Series; Is specific and makes the request more actionable by explicitly asking for a 'detailed explanation of character development'
